### ADD NEW FEEDBACK

> NOTE: As a baseline requirement, you must use Redux to store your data across views.

Create a multi-part form that allows users to leave feedback for today. 
There will be 4 views for the form parts.

Components:
 [x] How are you feeling today?
 [x] feeling](wireframes/feeling.png)
 [x] How well are you understanding the content?
 [x] understanding](wireframes/understanding.png) 
 [x] How well are you being supported?
 [x] (wireframes/supported.png)
 [x] Any comments you want to leave?


****While there is no nav bar*******
[x] each part of the form should be at its own route. 
[x] Clicking next should move the user to the appropriate step in the process.

### Input Validation

[x] Each step should only allow the user to advance to the next step if a score was provided. 
[x] Be sure to tell the user in some way that a value must be provided.

[x] The `Comments` step does not need to be validated, an empty value is okay.

## THE REVIEW COMPONENT

[x] The last step of the process will allow the user to review their feedback. Users are not able to change their input on this step or go back for Base Mode.

## SUBMIT THE FEEDBACK

[x] The `Review` step needs to have a submit button which will be clicked on to actually submit the completed feedback to the server.

[x] When the submit button is clicked, save the submission in the database. The user should see a submission success page. They can then click the button to take a new survey, which needs to reset all the data and go back to the first step.

*********Base Mode completed**********************
> NOTE: These stretch goals are intended to be completed in order

STEP 1:

[x] Allow the user to go back to a previous step and change their score. You still need to disallow empty values!

STEP 2:
[x] Improve the styling of the app using Material-UI. This might include cards, snackbars, buttons, a nav bar, icons, and/or a theme.

STEP 3: 
[x] Display all of the existing feedback at the route /admin. The most recently added feedback should appear at the top of the list. Allow the user to delete existing feedback. Prompt the user to confirm prior to deleting the feedback from the database.
